# DCOPs
A java library to simulate DCOPs algorithm.

BIP-based algorithms and their originals can be found in directory "src/algorithms/complete".
Parameter k is in file Parameter.java.
We can evaluate the BIP-based algorithms on benchmark problems by running file main.jave in directory "src/algorithms/testMain".
The experiment results will be presented in directory " problem/dcop/agent number/density".
